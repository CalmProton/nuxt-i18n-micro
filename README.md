## Key Features

- üåê **Compact Yet Powerful**: Despite its small size, `Nuxt I18n Micro` is designed for large-scale projects, focusing on performance and efficiency.
- ‚ö° **Optimized Build and Runtime**: Reduces build times, memory usage, and server load, making it ideal for high-traffic applications.
- üõ† **Minimalist Design**: The module is structured around just 5 components (1 module and 4 plugins), making it easy to understand, extend, and maintain.
- üìè **Efficient Routing**: Generates only 2 routes regardless of the number of locales, thanks to dynamic regex-based routing, unlike other i18n modules that generate separate routes for each locale.
- üóÇ **Streamlined Translation Loading**: Only JSON files are supported, with translations split between a global file for common texts (e.g., menus) and page-specific files, which are auto-generated in the `dev` mode if not present.

## Quick Setup

Install the module in your Nuxt application with:

```bash
npm install nuxt-i18n-micro
```

Then, add it to your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    'nuxt-i18n-micro',
  ],
  i18n: {
    locales: [
      { code: 'en', iso: 'en-US', dir: 'ltr' },
      { code: 'fr', iso: 'fr-FR', dir: 'ltr' },
      { code: 'ar', iso: 'ar-SA', dir: 'rtl' },
    ],
    defaultLocale: 'en',
    translationDir: 'locales',
    meta: true,
  },
})
```

That's it! You're now ready to use Nuxt I18n Micro in your Nuxt app.

## Folder Structure

Translations are organized into global and page-specific files:

```
/locales
  /pages
    /index
      en.json
      fr.json
      ar.json
    /about
      en.json
      fr.json
      ar.json
  en.json
  fr.json
  ar.json
```

- **Global File**: Located at `locales/{locale}.json` (e.g., `locales/en.json`). Used for common texts shared across multiple pages, such as menus.
- **Page-Specific Files**: Located at `locales/pages/{routeName}/{locale}.json` (e.g., `locales/pages/index/en.json`). These are used for translations specific to individual pages.

## Plugin Methods

### `$getLocale()`
Returns the current locale code.

```typescript
const locale = $getLocale()
```

### `$getLocales()`
Returns an array of all available locales configured in the module.

```typescript
const locales = $getLocales()
```

### `$t(key: string, params?: Record<string, any>, defaultValue?: string)`
Fetches a translation for the given key. Optionally interpolates parameters into the translation.

```typescript
const welcomeMessage = $t('welcome', { username: 'Alice', unreadCount: 5 })
```

### `$tc(key: string, count: number, defaultValue?: string)`
Fetches a pluralized translation for the given key based on the count.

```typescript
const appleCountMessage = $tc('apples', 10)
```

### `$switchLocale(locale: string)`
Switches to the given locale and redirects the user to the appropriate localized route.

```typescript
$switchLocale('fr')
```

### `$localeRoute(to: RouteLocationRaw, locale?: string): RouteLocationRaw`
Generates a localized route object based on the target route.

```typescript
const localizedRoute = $localeRoute({ name: 'index' })
```

### `$mergeTranslations(newTranslations: Translations)`
Merges new translations into the existing translation cache for the current route and locale.

```typescript
$mergeTranslations({
  welcome: 'Bienvenue, {username}!'
})
```

## `$defineI18nRoute(routeDefinition: { locales?: string[] | Record<string, Record<string, TranslationObject>> })`
Defines route behavior based on the current locale. This method can be used to control access to specific routes based on available locales or to provide translations for specific locales.

- `locales`: This property determines which locales are available for the route. It can be either:
  - An array of strings, where each string represents an available locale (e.g., `['en', 'fr', 'de']`).
  - An object where each key is a locale code, and the value is either an object containing translations or an empty object if you do not wish to provide translations for that locale.

### Example 1: Controlling Access Based on Locales

```typescript
import { useNuxtApp } from '#imports'

const { $defineI18nRoute } = useNuxtApp()

$defineI18nRoute({
  locales: ['en', 'fr', 'de'] // Only these locales are allowed for this route
})
```

### Example 2: Providing Translations for Locales

```typescript
import { useNuxtApp } from '#imports'

const { $defineI18nRoute } = useNuxtApp()

$defineI18nRoute({
  locales: {
    en: { greeting: 'Hello', farewell: 'Goodbye' },
    fr: { greeting: 'Bonjour', farewell: 'Au revoir' },
    de: { greeting: 'Hallo', farewell: { aaa: { bbb: "Auf Wiedersehen" } } },
    ru: {} // Russian locale is allowed but no translations are provided
  }
})
```

### Explanation:
- **Locales Array**: If you only want to specify which locales are allowed for a route, pass an array of locale codes. The user will only be able to access this route if the current locale is in this list.
- **Locales Object**: If you want to provide specific translations for each locale, pass an object where each key is a locale code. The value should be an object with key-value pairs for translations. If you do not wish to provide translations for a locale but still want to allow access, pass an empty object (`{}`) for that locale.

## useNuxtApp

```ts
import { useNuxtApp } from '#imports'

const { $getLocale, $switchLocale, $getLocales, $localeRoute, $t } = useNuxtApp()
```

## Composable

```ts
import { useI18n } from '#imports'

const { $getLocale, $switchLocale, $getLocales, $localeRoute, $t } = useI18n()
// or
const i18n = useI18n()

```

## Example

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>{{ $t('key2.key2.key2.key2.key2') }}</p>
    <p>Current Locale: {{ $getLocale() }}</p>

    <div>
      {{ $t('welcome', { username: 'Alice', unreadCount: 5 }) }}
    </div>
    <div>
      {{ $tc('apples', 10) }}
    </div>

    <div>
      <button
        v-for="locale in $getLocales()"
        :key="locale"
        :disabled="locale === $getLocale()"
        @click="$switchLocale(locale.code)"
      >
        Switch to {{ locale.code }}
      </button>
    </div>

    <div>
      <NuxtLink :to="$localeRoute({ name: 'index' })">
        Go to Index
      </NuxtLink>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
  import { useI18n } from '#imports'

  const { $getLocale, $switchLocale, $getLocales, $localeRoute, $t, $tc } = useI18n()
</script>

```

## Module Options

The module accepts the following options in the Nuxt configuration:

- **locales**: An array of locale objects. Each locale should have a `code`, and optionally, `iso` and `dir` (for RTL/LTR).
  - Example:
    ```typescript
    locales: [
      { code: 'en', iso: 'en-US', dir: 'ltr' },
      { code: 'fr', iso: 'fr-FR', dir: 'ltr' },
      { code: 'ar', iso: 'ar-SA', dir: 'rtl' }
    ]
    ```
- **meta**: A boolean indicating whether to automatically generate SEO-related meta tags (like `alternate` links).
- **defaultLocale**: The default locale code (e.g., `'en'`).
- **translationDir**: The directory where translation files are stored (e.g., `'locales'`).
- **autoDetectLanguage**: If `true`, automatically detects the user's preferred language and redirects accordingly.
- **plural**: A custom function for handling pluralization.
- **includeDefaultLocaleRoute**: A boolean. If enabled, all routes without a locale prefix will redirect to the default locale route.
- **cache**: (In development) A boolean option designed to optimize performance when working with large JSON translation files. When enabled, it caches translations specific to the current page, reducing search times and minimizing client-side load. This cached data is then sent to the client, resulting in faster page loads and improved user experience.

## Locale Loading in Nuxt I18n Micro

The `Nuxt I18n Micro` module provides an efficient way to manage internationalization (i18n) in your Nuxt application, with a focus on performance and simplicity. One of the key features of this module is how it handles the loading of locale-specific translations. Below is an explanation of how this process works.

### How Locale Loading Works

In `Nuxt I18n Micro`, translations are loaded dynamically based on the user's selected locale. The module uses a specific route pattern (`/_locales/:page/:locale/data.json`) to fetch the translation files for each page and locale. This approach is designed to minimize the initial load time and only load the necessary translations for the current page and locale.

#### Route Structure

The translations are organized into JSON files located in the `locales` directory. These files are split into:

- **Global Files**: Located at `locales/{locale}.json` (e.g., `locales/en.json`). These files contain translations shared across the entire application, such as menu items or common UI elements.
- **Page-Specific Files**: Located at `locales/pages/{routeName}/{locale}.json` (e.g., `locales/pages/index/en.json`). These files contain translations specific to individual pages.

#### Dynamic Locale Routes

To accommodate the dynamic nature of translation loading, `Nuxt I18n Micro` extends the default routing configuration by adding locale-specific routes. This means that for each page, a localized version of the route is generated. For example, if your application has an `index` page and supports English (`en`) and French (`fr`), the following routes would be generated:

- `/en/index`
- `/fr/index`

This structure allows the module to load the appropriate translations based on the user's selected locale.

### Loading Translations via _locales Route

Given the way Vite and Nuxt handle modules, the `Nuxt I18n Micro` module uses a special route (`/_locales/:page/:locale/data.json`) to fetch translations. This is necessary because, during the build process, Vite may not bundle all translation files directly into the application. Instead, the module dynamically loads these files from the server as needed.

When a user navigates to a page, the module will:

1. Check if the necessary translation file for the current page and locale is already loaded in the cache.
2. If not, it will send a request to the `_locales` route to fetch the required translation file.
3. Once the translation file is loaded, it is cached for future use, ensuring that the translations are readily available when the user navigates to another part of the application.

### Caching and Pre-rendering

To further optimize performance, `Nuxt I18n Micro` supports caching and pre-rendering of translation files:

- **Caching**: Once a translation file is loaded, it is stored in the cache, reducing the need for subsequent requests.
- **Pre-rendering**: During the build process, the module can pre-render translation files for all configured locales and routes, which are then served directly from the server without the need for runtime requests.


Certainly! Here's an updated section for your README that includes the description of the `<i18n-t>` component, along with explanations for each prop and examples of usage.

---

## `<i18n-t>` Component

The `<i18n-t>` component in `Nuxt I18n Micro` is a flexible and powerful tool designed to handle translations within your Nuxt application. It supports various features such as interpolation, pluralization, and dynamic HTML rendering.

### Component Props

- **`keypath`** (`string`, required): The translation key used to look up the corresponding translation string from the locale files.

- **`plural`** (`number | null`, optional): The count used for pluralization. If provided, the component will use the `$tc` method for translating based on the pluralization rules defined for the locale.

- **`tag`** (`string`, optional, default: `'span'`): The HTML tag used to wrap the translated content. You can specify any valid HTML tag, such as `div`, `p`, `h1`, etc.

- **`scope`** (`string`, optional, default: `'global'`): Specifies the scope of the translation. This prop is useful if you have different translation scopes in your application, although the default is set to `'global'`.

- **`params`** (`Record<string, string | number | boolean>`, optional, default: `() => ({})`): An object containing key-value pairs to be interpolated into the translation string. This is useful for dynamic translations where certain values need to be inserted into the text.

- **`defaultValue`** (`string`, optional, default: `''`): A fallback translation that will be displayed if the `keypath` does not match any key in the translation files.

- **`html`** (`boolean`, optional, default: `false`): A flag indicating whether the translation contains HTML. When set to `true`, the translated string will be rendered as raw HTML.

- **`locale`** (`string`, optional): The locale to use for this translation. If not provided, the component will use the current locale set by the application.

- **`wrap`** (`boolean`, optional, default: `true`): Determines if the translated content should be wrapped in the specified `tag`. If set to `false`, the component will not wrap the translation in an HTML element.

- **`customPluralRule`** (`(value: string, count: number, locale: string) => string`, optional): A custom function for handling pluralization. This allows you to override the default pluralization behavior with your custom logic.

- **`hideIfEmpty`** (`boolean`, optional, default: `false`): If `true`, the component will not render anything if the translation string is empty. This is useful for conditional rendering based on the presence of a translation.

### Examples of Usage

#### Basic Usage

```vue
<i18n-t keypath="welcomeMessage"></i18n-t>
```

This will render the translation associated with the key `welcomeMessage` using the current locale.

#### Pluralization

```vue
<i18n-t keypath="apples" :plural="10" tag="div"></i18n-t>
```

This will handle the pluralization for the translation key `apples` and render it inside a `div` element.

#### Interpolation with Parameters

```vue
<i18n-t keypath="greeting" :params="{ name: 'John' }"></i18n-t>
```

Assuming the translation string is `"Hello, {name}!"`, this will render `"Hello, John!"`.

#### Rendering with HTML Content

```vue
<i18n-t keypath="richText" :html="true"></i18n-t>
```

If `richText` contains HTML content like `"<strong>Welcome</strong> to our site!"`, setting `html` to `true` will render the HTML directly.

#### Using a Custom Locale

```vue
<i18n-t keypath="welcomeMessage" locale="fr"></i18n-t>
```

This will render the translation in French, overriding the application's current locale.

#### Conditional Rendering

```vue
<i18n-t keypath="optionalMessage" :hideIfEmpty="true"></i18n-t>
```

This will render nothing if the translation for `optionalMessage` is empty.

#### Custom Pluralization Rule

```vue
<i18n-t
  keypath="items"
  :plural="itemCount"
  :customPluralRule="(value, count, locale) => {
    return count === 1 ? 'One item' : value.replace('{count}', `${count}`)
  }"></i18n-t>
```

This uses a custom function to handle the pluralization, bypassing the default logic.

### Advanced Example

```vue
<i18n-t
  keypath="notifications"
  :plural="unreadCount"
  tag="p"
  :params="{ username: 'Alice' }"
  defaultValue="You have no notifications"
  :html="false"
  locale="en"
  :wrap="true"
  :hideIfEmpty="false">
</i18n-t>
```

### Slot Usage Example

Here's how you can use the slot and access the `translation` within it:

```vue
<i18n-t keypath="welcomeMessage">
  <template #default="{ translation }">
    <strong>{{ translation }}</strong>
  </template>
</i18n-t>
```

### Explanation:

- **Slot Prop `translation`**:
  - The component now provides `translation` as a slot prop, which can be accessed in the parent component‚Äôs slot content.
  - In this example, the translation is wrapped in a `<strong>` tag, allowing you to apply custom styling or further modify how the translation is displayed.

---

The `<i18n-t>` component provides a powerful and flexible way to handle translations in your Nuxt application, accommodating a wide range of use cases from simple text translations to complex pluralization and HTML rendering scenarios.
