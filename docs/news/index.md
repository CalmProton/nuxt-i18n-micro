## Optimized Translation Loading Algorithm Released

**Date**: 2025-01-10

**Version Introduced**: `v1.58.0`

![Optimized Loading Demo](/optimized-loading.png)

We are thrilled to announce the release of a **new algorithm for loading translations** in Nuxt I18n Micro. This update introduces significant performance improvements, a cleaner architecture, and more efficient memory usage.

### Whatâ€™s New?

The new translation-loading algorithm focuses on:
1. **Optimized File Merging**: Enhanced the deep merge functionality to handle translations more efficiently.
2. **Caching Enhancements**: Leveraged server storage for pre-rendered translations, reducing redundant computations.
3. **Streamlined Code**: Simplified file paths and structure for better maintainability.

### Key Benefits

#### **1. Faster Build Times**
The new algorithm reduces build times by efficiently handling translation files and minimizing memory overhead.

- **Old Build Time**: 7.20 seconds
- **New Build Time**: 6.91 seconds
- **Improvement**: **4.03% faster**

#### **2. Reduced CPU Usage**
Lower maximum and average CPU usage during builds and stress tests:

- **Build Max CPU**: From **257.60%** â†’ **198.20%** (23.06% lower)
- **Stress Test Avg CPU**: From **93.85%** â†’ **89.14%** (5.01% lower)

#### **3. Lower Memory Usage**
Memory consumption has been significantly optimized across builds and runtime stress tests:

- **Build Max Memory**: From **1286.00 MB** â†’ **885.19 MB** (31.15% lower)
- **Stress Test Max Memory**: From **624.22 MB** â†’ **429.52 MB** (31.20% lower)

#### **4. Enhanced Response Times**
Stress test response times saw drastic improvement:

- **Average Response Time**: From **411.50 ms** â†’ **9.30 ms** (97.74% faster)
- **Max Response Time**: From **2723.00 ms** â†’ **187.00 ms** (93.13% faster)

#### **5. Increased Request Throughput**
The new algorithm boosts the number of handled requests per second:

- **Requests per Second**: From **288.00** â†’ **305.00** (5.90% increase)

---

### Why Itâ€™s Important

Localization is essential for global applications, and improving translation-loading performance can have a direct impact on:
- **User Experience**: Faster response times lead to a smoother user experience.
- **Scalability**: Lower resource usage allows better handling of high traffic.
- **Developer Productivity**: Reduced build times and a simplified codebase streamline workflows.

---

### How It Works

1. **Efficient Deep Merging**
  - The algorithm has been rewritten to handle translation merging more intelligently, ensuring minimal memory overhead and faster operations.

2. **Smart Caching**
  - Server-side storage is now used to cache translations during pre-rendering, which are then reused during runtime. This avoids repetitive reads and merges.

3. **Streamlined File Loading**
  - Translation files are loaded in a more predictable and maintainable way by unifying fallback handling and caching.


## [New CLI Feature: `text-to-i18n`](/guide/cli#ðŸ”„-text-to-i18n-command)

**Date**: 2024-12-24

**Cli Version Introduced**: `v1.1.0`

![text-to-i18n Command Demo](/text-to-i18n.gif)

Weâ€™re excited to announce the new `text-to-i18n` command in the Nuxt I18n Micro CLI! This powerful feature automates the process of extracting hardcoded text strings from your codebase and converting them into i18n translation keys. Itâ€™s designed to save time, reduce errors, and streamline your localization workflow.

### Key Benefits

- **Automated Text Extraction**: Scans Vue templates, JavaScript, and TypeScript files.
- **Seamless Key Generation**: Creates structured translation keys based on file paths and content.
- **Efficient Translation Management**: Updates your translation files while preserving existing entries.

### How It Works

1. **File Scanning**: Processes files in key directories like `pages`, `components`, and `plugins`.
2. **Text Processing**: Identifies and extracts translatable strings, generating unique keys.
3. **Translation Updates**: Automatically inserts new keys into your translation files and maintains their nested structure.

### Usage

```bash
i18n-micro text-to-i18n [options]
```

Example:

```bash
i18n-micro text-to-i18n --translationFile locales/en.json --context auth
```

### Example Transformations

#### Before
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to our site</h1>
    <p>Please sign in to continue</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

#### After
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ $t('pages.home.welcome_to_our_site') }}</h1>
    <p>{{ $t('pages.home.please_sign_in') }}</p>
  </div>
</template>
```
