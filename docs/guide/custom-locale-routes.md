# üîó Custom Localized Routes with `localeRoutes` in `Nuxt I18n Micro`

## üìñ Introduction to `localeRoutes`

The `localeRoutes` feature in `Nuxt I18n Micro` allows you to define custom routes for specific locales, offering flexibility and control over the routing structure of your application. This feature is particularly useful when certain locales require different URL structures, tailored paths, or need to follow specific regional or linguistic conventions.

## üöÄ Primary Use Case of `localeRoutes`

The primary use case for `localeRoutes` is to provide distinct routes for different locales, enhancing the user experience by ensuring URLs are intuitive and relevant to the target audience. For example, you might have different paths for English and Russian versions of a page, where the Russian locale follows a localized URL format.

### üìÑ Example: Defining `localeRoutes` in `$defineI18nRoute`

Here‚Äôs an example of how you might define custom routes for specific locales using `localeRoutes` in your `$defineI18nRoute` function:

```typescript
$defineI18nRoute({
  localeRoutes: {
    ru: '/localesubpage', // Custom route path for the Russian locale
    de: '/lokaleseite',   // Custom route path for the German locale
  },
})
```

### üîÑ How `localeRoutes` Work

- **Default Behavior**: Without `localeRoutes`, all locales use a common route structure defined by the primary path.
- **Custom Behavior**: With `localeRoutes`, specific locales can have their own routes, overriding the default path with locale-specific routes defined in the configuration.

## üå± Use Cases for `localeRoutes`

### üìÑ Example: Using `localeRoutes` in a Page

Here‚Äôs a simple Vue component demonstrating the use of `$defineI18nRoute` with `localeRoutes`:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Display greeting message based on the current locale -->
    <p>{{ $t('greeting') }}</p>

    <!-- Navigation links -->
    <div>
      <NuxtLink :to="$localeRoute({ name: 'index' })">
        Go to Index
      </NuxtLink>
      |
      <NuxtLink :to="$localeRoute({ name: 'about' })">
        Go to About Page
      </NuxtLink>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { useNuxtApp } from '#imports'

const { $getLocale, $switchLocale, $getLocales, $localeRoute, $t, $defineI18nRoute } = useNuxtApp()

// Define translations and custom routes for specific locales
$defineI18nRoute({
  localeRoutes: {
    ru: '/localesubpage', // Custom route path for Russian locale
  },
})
</script>
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Using `localeRoutes` in Different Contexts

- **Landing Pages**: Use custom routes to localize URLs for landing pages, ensuring they align with marketing campaigns.
- **Documentation Sites**: Provide distinct routes for each locale to better match the localized content structure.
- **E-commerce Sites**: Tailor product or category URLs per locale for improved SEO and user experience.

## Using Navigation with `localeRoutes`

As localised routes don't directly match filenames in the page directory, you need to reference your navigation by object rather than by name.

```vue
<template>
  /**
   * Exemple page: /pages/about-us.vue
   * EN /about-us
   * ES /sobre-nosotros
   * FR /a-propos
   */
  
  // Using NuxtLink
  <NuxtLink :to="$localeRoute({ name: 'about-us' })">
    Go to About Page
  </NuxtLink>
  
  // Using I18nLink
  <I18nLink :to="{ name: 'about-us' }">
    Go to About Page
  </NuxtLink>
  
  // The string literal navigation wouldn't work for any locale but english
  <I18nLink to="/about-us">
    Go to About Page
  </NuxtLink>
</template>
```

### Nested Page Naming

By default, your pages are named based on their file & path name. Here's what it means:
- `/pages/about-us.vue` can be accessed with `$localeRoute({ name: 'about-us' })`
- `/pages/about-us/physical-stores.vue` can be accessed with `$localeRoute({ name: 'about-us-physical-stores' })`

To override this behaviour, explicitly name your page with `definePageMeta`.

```vue
// /pages/about-us/physical-stores.vue
<script setup>
definePageMeta({
  name: 'our-stores'
})
```


This page can now be referenced with either `$localeRoute` or `I18nLink` by its name `:to='{ name: "our-stores" }'`.

## üìù Best Practices for Using `localeRoutes`

- **üöÄ Use for Relevant Locales**: Apply `localeRoutes` primarily where the URL structure significantly impacts the user experience or SEO. Avoid overuse for minor differences.
- **üîß Maintain Consistency**: Keep a consistent routing pattern across locales unless there's a strong reason to deviate. This approach helps in maintaining clarity and reducing complexity.
- **üìö Document Custom Routes**: Clearly document any custom routes you define with `localeRoutes`, especially in modular applications, to ensure team members understand the routing logic.
