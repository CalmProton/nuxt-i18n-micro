# Performance Test Results

## Project Information

- **i18n-micro Path**: ./test/fixtures/i18n-micro
- **i18n Path**: ./test/fixtures/i18n
- **Test Script Location**: ./test/performance.test.ts

### Description:
This performance test compares two implementations of internationalization: **i18n-micro** and **i18n**.
The main focus of the test is to evaluate build times, memory usage, CPU usage, and the performance of the server under stress (e.g., how many requests can be handled and how efficiently).
The **i18n-micro** implementation shows slightly lower overall script execution times.
This difference is attributed to its ability to handle more requests, which requires additional time for processing.

### Important Note:
It is essential to recognize that the example used in this test is not entirely representative of the intended usage pattern for **i18n-micro**. The example simplifies the translation structure by consolidating all translations into a single file. However, **i18n-micro** is optimized for scenarios where translations are organized on a per-page basis. This approach allows for more granular control and efficiency, particularly in large-scale applications. The current setup is used merely for demonstration purposes and may not fully showcase the potential performance benefits of **i18n-micro** in real-world applications.
